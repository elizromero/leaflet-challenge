# leaflet-challenge

This project focuses on building a web-based visualization for earthquake data provided by the United States Geological Survey (USGS). The goal is to create an interactive map that displays real-time earthquake data, helping the public and government organizations better understand seismic activity and its impact on Earth.

This project uses HTML for structure, CSS for styling, Leaflet.js to create the interactive map, and D3.js to fetch and parse GeoJSON data from the USGS, enabling a dynamic and visually appealing earthquake visualization.

Contents:

index.html: Contains the basic structure of the webpage.
style.css: Provides styling for the map and legend.
logic.js: Includes the JavaScript code to fetch data, process it, and render the map with Leaflet.
